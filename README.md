__OpenL2M, Open Layer 2 Management__, is an open source switch management
application designed to provide a consistent web interface for Layer 2 device
management, independent of the underlying switch vendor.  

OpenL2M was developed in an attempt to learn
Django, and in the hope that it may some day provide a possibly useful
application for distributed "basic" network switch management.
It is developed to address the needs of distributed IT groups managing parts
of a distributed layer 2 ("switching") network.
