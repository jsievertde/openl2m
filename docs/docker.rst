We provide `Docker Compose configuration files <https://github.com/openl2m/openl2m/tree/main/docker/test>`_ to quickly test OpenL2M without configuring a full production setup.
Please see the sources at *./docker/test/*

The roadmap goals do include establishing production level Docker Compose configuration files.
