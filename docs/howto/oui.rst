Ethernet OUIs

**Updating the Ethernet OUI database**

Starting with v2.3.3, OpenL2M uses the "manuf" library, which uses the Wireshark ethernet vendor list.

This library is automatically updated during the upgrade process. To upgrade this library in between version upgrades,
stop OpenL2M, and run *upgrade.sh* again.
