If you hover your mouse over a switch, you see a description (if defined by your admin)
Click on a switch to manage that device. Note that **all data** is read **live** from the switch via SNMP,
so this make take a little bit. After a little bit of patience, this will bring you to the
:doc:`the Basic Switch View <basic_view>`, showing all (visible) interfaces of the device.
