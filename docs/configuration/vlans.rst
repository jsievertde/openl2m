=====================================
Create the VLANs that will be managed
=====================================

**VLANs**

VLANs represent the vlan ID and name as you are used to on a network.
The combination of ID and name are unique, so you can overload names for a
single ID. VLANs can be grouped in VLAN Groups, or individually selected
in a SwitchGroup.

**VLAN Groups**

These are groupings of vlans that you can give a name. This allows for a simple
adding of a number of vlans to a Switch Group. E.g. create a VLAN Group named
"Wifi VLANs" that has as members all the wireless client vlans in your
organization. This can then be applied in one or more Switch Groups.
