=============
Configuration
=============

All OpenL2M configuration has to be performed from an account marked as 'Admin'.
Initially, this will be the admin account created during install.

After login, go to the top right menu under the username, and choose the "Admin" option to get
into the Django admin interface.

Here is the order in which you should create the configuration items:
