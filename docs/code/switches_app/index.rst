================
The switches app
================

The switches/ directory contains the main app where nearly all the
functionality is implemented. Most of the rest of this document describes
various aspects of this app.

**urls.py**
In standard Django fashion, here we map the various urls of our app.

**models.py**
We define a number of classes/objects here.

**Choices**

Several models, ie Django objects defined in models.py, have a list of "choices"
defined in the class definition. These choices are visible in the admin interface,
e.g. when you create a new SNMP Profile.

If you want to refer to these choices from a template (ie on the web page),
you can use the format model.get_*fieldname*_display,
where *fieldname* is the name of the field in the model that has choice.
Eg. the Log() object defined in models.py, has attributes called
'type' and 'action'. These fields have a list of choices
that show several fields ("View", "Change", "Error", "Warning").

To show these values in the log view template, see   templates/_tab_logs.html,
we use the format  {{ l.get_type_display }}  and   {{ l.get_action_display }}

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#field-choices
This statuses  "For each model field that has choices set, Django will add a
method to retrieve the human-readable name for the fieldâ€™s current value.
See get_FOO_display() in the database API documentation."

**views.py**
As is typical in a Django framework application, this is where most of the
work to handle urls is done. Please read :doc:`Views <views>`


**Connections**

Connections to the switch are based on a Connector() class.

See :doc:`Connections <connections>`

**SNMP specific implementation**

Several vendors allow a pure Snmp connector. The base SnmpConnector() and related code is in the
*switches/connect/* directory.

See :doc:`SNMP Connector <snmp>`

**Vendor specific implementations**

See here how to add new vendors that require non-standard connector classes.
See :doc:`Vendor implementations <vendor_specific>`

**Netmiko for CLI**

We use the Netmiko framework to establish SSH CLI sessions to execute commands.

See :doc:`Netmiko Connector <netmiko>`
