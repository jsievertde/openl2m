==========
Code Style
==========

We welcome add code additions, via Git Pull-Requests, or email, or whatever fashion works for you!

As of v2.4.8, we use *black* to enforce the code style. For more details see
https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html

To document functions and classes, we use the Google comment style, see more at
https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

New code should adhere to this, and add Python type hinting.

Function calls with more then one parameter should use named parameters, instead of position-based calling.
