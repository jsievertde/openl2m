==========
Code Style
==========

We attempt to use the Django style guide, which is based on PEP8. See more at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/

To document functions and classes, we use the Google comment style, see more at
https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Finally, as code is checked into git, we run it through *pycodestyle*, to enforce uniform appearance.

We also use Flake8 to do some code sanity checking...
