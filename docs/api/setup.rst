=========
API Setup
=========

In order to use the REST API, your user account will need to have at least one token assigned to it.

To create a token, you can go to the top right menu, and select "API Tokens". 

Additionally, tokens can be generated by an administrator from the Web GUI administrative interface,
or from the OpenL2M command line interface, as such:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv)$ python3 manage.py user_create_token <username>

Please contact you administrator for additional help.

API Testing
-----------

You can test the API from the command line on most systems, by making HTTP "GET" calls. Once you have your token,
you can do something like the examples below to get the list of devices you can access:

.. code-block: bash

    curl -X GET https://<your-doimain>/api/switches/ -H 'Authorization: Token <your-token-string-here>'


With the Python HTTPIE package, the following is an elegant way to test:

.. code-block: bash

    http https://<your-domain>/api/switches/ 'Authorization: Token <your-token-string-here>'


Once you have successfully tested access, you can start using :doc:`the various API endpoints available.<endpoints>`
