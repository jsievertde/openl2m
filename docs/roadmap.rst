===============
Roadmap / To Do
===============

Planned for version 1.2
-----------------------

* Single-Sign-On (SSO) via SAML, and possibly OAUTH for authorization (switch group membership)
  with as primary SSO compatibility target Shiboleth SAML SSO


Other Features
--------------

Here are some other features we are considering implementing (*in no particular order!*)

* IP v6 support, both for switch snmp access, and other informational tables.

* Tagged/Trunked ports tagged vlan management (we can do the untagged vlan now)

* hide change/submit buttons until form has changes (vlan, ifalias, etc.)

* make vendor support dynamic (i.e. discover at runtime what vendors are supported)

* importing of switches from other NMS, e.g. Observium, LibreNMS, Netdisco, Nagios, etc.

* code optimization (move duplicates to functions, session storage, etc.)
