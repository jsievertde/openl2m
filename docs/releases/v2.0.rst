Version 2.0
===========

Version 2.0.1
-----------------
Release Date: 2021-09-09

* add command to remove old logs, docs HowTo section
* add a few total use counters to usage statistics view
* some documentation updates

Version 2.0.0
-----------------
Release Date: 2021-09-02

* simple read-only support for Aruba AOS-CX switches.
  Note: as SNMP in AOS-CX is read-only, this will need a dedicated driver
  using the Aruba REST interface (pyaoscx module). Implementation TBD.
* documentation updates.
* lldp parsing fix for multiple capabilities.

Version 2.0.0-rc3
-----------------
Release Date: 2021-08-19

* Various fixes.

Version 2.0.0-rc2
-----------------
Release Date: 2021-07-20

* Various fixes.
* Rewrite of various templates for performance and simplicity

Version 2.0.0-rc1
-----------------
Release Date: 2021-02-23

* Complete rewrite of the internal code. There now is a generic Connector() class
  that implements an interface that is called from the Django views. Technology and/or vendor
  specific implementations inherit from this class to implement their version of that interface.
  Additionally, a new session caching strategy is implemented. This should make it easier to
  implement a device cache, so others can have quick access to device settings, without
  the need to re-read the device.
* To **demonstrate the use of the above API class** we implemented a very basic Python Napalm library
  interface on top of this API class. This is **solely intended to show how to implement new drivers**. The NapalmConnector()
  supports a few vendors (Arista, Cisco, Dell, HP, Juniper), but only in read-only mode.
  **NOTE**: the Napalm library does not properly support trunked or 802.1q tagged interfaces.
  We try to 'catch' this, but the untagged vlan is likely incorrect on trunked/tagged interfaces
  due to this library shortcoming. It also does not support PoE.
* if LDAP enabled, add log entry showing DN of authenticated ldap account.
* password change option for local accounts
* add user profile view

Bug fixes:

* show (missing) vlans on tagged Cisco interfaces
* many other miscellaneous fixes

Upgrades:

* upgrade to Django v3.2, and recent version of web libraries.
* upgrade to most recent versions of python packages used.
* using more 'native' python libraries (e.g. netaddr)
* use tmpfiles.d configuration file for celeryd installation
* add two configuration settings to make SSL more secure:

.. code-block:: bash

  # if using SSL, these should be set to True:
  CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
  SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
