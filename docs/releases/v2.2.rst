===========
Version 2.2
===========

*Note: from this version on, we are now developing and testing in Python v3.8.
Python v3.6 is no longer supported!*

**Version 2.2 adds support for Aruba AOS-CX devices.** PoE and LLDP do not function yet,
due to Aruba library shortcomings.

Release Date: 2022-06-07

* Add Administrative LogEntry view to admin pages.
* handle white-space around device searches.

Version 2.2.1

Release Date: 2022-06-06

* On AOS-CX switches when configured for SNMP, implement read/write of interface enable/disable
  and PoE enable/disable, and read PoE consumed power. (this required v10.08 or later firmware)

Bug Fixes:

* templates handle device capabilities properly (i.e. disable field forms when driver does not implement changing it)

-----------

Release Date: 2022-05-26

Version 2.2-dev3
----------------

Release Date: 2022-05-19

* AOS-CX switches now require API v10.08 (ie firmware 10.08 or newer)
* added capabilities to read the ethernet(mac) tables on AOS-CX switches
  **Note:** PoE, LLDP and ARP are not implemented yet in the library
  (or malfunctioning), so this is missing in OpenL2M!
