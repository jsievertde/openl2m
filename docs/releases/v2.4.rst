===========
Version 2.4
===========

**Version 2.4 upgrades the Django framework to v4.2**

*Django v4.2 requires Python v3.8 or later, and PostgreSQL 12 or later*

*Note: from this version on, we are developing and testing on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS,
using Python v3.10 and PostgreSql 14!*

We also add the **ability to create, edit or delete vlans in SNMP devices**.

.. note::

    You now need to set or add the *CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS* variable to your *configuration.py*
    to protect against Cross Site Request Forgery.
    This needs to include the schema, i.e. 'https://' or 'http://' if not secured!
    See the installation steps for more details.
