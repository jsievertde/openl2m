Configuration changes
---------------------

Run upgrade.sh first!

To enable task scheduling via Celery, you need to add the following to configuration.py:
.. code-block:: bash

  TASKS_ENABLED = True

To send separate emails with the results of tasks to ADMINS, set this:

.. code-block:: bash

  TASKS_BCC_ADMINS = True

You will need to set one or more email destinations in ADMINS !

If you have installed Celery according to the documentation, you should not need to touch these:

.. code-block:: bash

  CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379'
  CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379'
  CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['application/json']
  CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
  CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'

To send emails with the results of Bulk-Edit jobs, set these, if needed.
The defaults assume a local smtp server. See the installation section
and configuration.example.py for more.

.. code-block:: bash

  EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
  EMAIL_PORT = 25
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
  EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
  EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
  EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE = None
  EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE = None
  EMAIL_TIMEOUT = 10
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS = '<openl2m@localhost>'
  EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = '[OpenL2M] '
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS = '<openl2m@localhost>'

Once this is complete, :doc:`follow the steps in the Tasks installation section<../installation/tasks>`.
