V1.1 Configuration changes
--------------------------

See also the :doc:`the Tasks installation section<../installation/tasks>`.

Run upgrade.sh first!

To enable task scheduling via Celery, you need to add the following to configuration.py:
.. code-block:: bash

  TASKS_ENABLED = True

To send separate emails with the results of tasks to ADMINS, set this:

.. code-block:: bash

  TASKS_BCC_ADMINS = True

You will need to set one or more email destinations in ADMINS !

The default time selector for tasks uses a 12-hour AM/PM clock. If you want to use 24 Hour time format, set to True.

.. code-block:: bash

  TASK_USE_24HR_TIME = False

By default, users can choose time in 5 minute increments (0,5,10,15,...). Change this to set an increment as save_needed

.. code-block:: bash

  TASK_SUBMIT_MINUTE_INCREMENT = 5

By default, users can schedules tasks up to 28 days (4 weeks) into the future. Set this as needed.

.. code-block:: bash

  TASK_SUBMIT_MAX_DAYS_IN_FUTURE = 28

To send emails with the results of Bulk-Edit jobs, set these, if needed.
The defaults assume a local smtp server. See the installation section
and configuration.example.py for more.

.. code-block:: bash

  EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
  EMAIL_PORT = 25
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
  EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
  EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
  EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE = None
  EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE = None
  EMAIL_TIMEOUT = 10
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS = '<openl2m@localhost>'
  EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = '[OpenL2M-Admin] '
  EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX_USER = '[OpenL2M] '
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS = '<openl2m@localhost>'

.. warning::

  If you have installed Redis/Celery according to the documentation, you should not need to change these.
  Only change these settings if need to customize your Redis server configuration!

.. code-block:: bash

    CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379'
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379'
    CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['application/json']
    CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
    CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'


Once these steps are complete, :doc:`follow the steps in the Tasks installation section<../installation/tasks>`.
