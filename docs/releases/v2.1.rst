Version 2.1.1
-------------

Release date: 2021-10-12

* *New feature:* Syslog functionality.

If defined, all logs can also be sent to a syslog server. From the configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Syslog settings
  # if SYSLOG_HOST is defined (default=False), log entries will also be sent here, to the 'user' facility:
  # SYSLOG_HOST = 'localhost'
  # if needed, you can change the UDP port:
  # SYSLOG_PORT = 514
  # By default SYSLOG_JSON=True, and syslog entries will be send in Json format for easier parsing.
  # If not, a textual version of log event will be sent.
  # SYSLOG_JSON = True

* *New feature:* Allow All Vlans setting per group

You can now define an attribute at the group level that allows all vlans on all devices in that group.

* Bug fixes:

  * fix long-standing LDAP login error, creating profile failed under certain situations.
  * ethernet OUI update script auto-senses python version
  * various other small fixes

Version 2.1.0
-------------
Release Date: 2021-10-07

* *New Feature:* Command Templates.

We have added the ability to define command templates that allow input from users before they are run.
This can be used to allow users to fill in eg. an ip address before a specific command is run on the device.

Command Templates allow you to administratively define commands with variables in them. These variables can be filled in
using a form presented in the switch view. This provides tremendous flexibility giving users in a
controlled fashion more visibility into the device.

Also adds a Commands-Only connector: if you want to add a device where users can only run pre-defined commands.
This device will not read interfaces and not show the Interface and Bulk Edit tabs.

:doc:`See the documentation for more.<../configuration/cmd_templates>`


* *New Feature:* update the Ethernet OUI library

The python netaddr library is used to get the vendor for a specific ethernet address (i.e. the OUI part). The database provided
with the package is old. We have created a script to update this database. This is automatically run during the upgrade.sh script.
If you want to manually upgrade (even when OpenL2M is running!), run the update_oui script as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  # manually upgrade OUI database
  cd /opt/openl2m/scripts
  ./update_oui.sh
