Version 2.1.0
-------------
Release Date: 2021-TBD

New Feature:  Command templates.

We have added the ability to define command templates that allow input from users before they are run.
This can be used to allow users to fill in eg. an ip address before a specific command is run on the device.

Command Templates allow you to administratively define commands with variables in them. These variables can be filled in
using a form presented in the switch view. This provides tremendous flexibility giving users in a
controlled fashion more visibility into the device.

Also adds a Commands-Only connector: if you want to add a device where users can only run pre-defined commands.
This device will read interfaces and not show the Interface and Bulk Edit tabs.
